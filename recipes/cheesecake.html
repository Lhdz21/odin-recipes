    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 packages (20 sheets) graham crackers </li>
        <li>11 tablespoons (1 3/8 sticks) unsalted butter, melted </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar </li>
        <li>2 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature </li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can (1 1/4 cups) sweetened condensed milk </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag, and crush them with a rolling pin until very fine crumbs form.</li>
        <li>Pour crumbs into a medium bowl; stir in sugar. Add butter, and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Press the crumb mixture into a 9-inch springform pan, spreading it 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the side; press flat. Chill crust in freezer at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the filling: Using an electric mixer set at medium-high speed, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the condensed milk a little at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl, as necessary. Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the crust; smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Unclasp sides of pan, and remove cheesecake.</li>

    </ol>
